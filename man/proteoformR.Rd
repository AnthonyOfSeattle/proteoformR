\title{Build a breakpoint model for each reference in a tidy format dataframe.}
\usage{
proteoformR(data, vals, ref = NULL, start = NULL, end = NULL,
  batch = NULL, lambda = 10, method = "PL_L0")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe in tidy format containing at least one column of continuous values}

\item{vals}{Column name for values within data}

\item{ref}{Column name for strings which partition values into protein references}

\item{start}{Start position for each peptide}

\item{end}{Ending position for each peptide}

\item{batch}{Batching information. In most cases this will be the sample number for each measurement.}

\item{lambda}{Penalty term to apply to each L0 optimization.}

\item{method}{Deprecated, will likely be reformatted later}
}
\value{
An S3 object with class of type, "bpmodel", which contains the manipulated input, 
a dataframe of breakpoints, and a predicted best model.
}
\description{
\code{proteoformR} uses a Rcpp dynamic programming backend to solve an L0 penalized changepoint model for each protein. 
For the best performance, each sample should be treated as a batch, but the only required arguments are data and vals; 
all other arguments are suggestions and will only be used if supplied. This function performs sorting and sclaing internally,
so don't worry about preprocessing data.
